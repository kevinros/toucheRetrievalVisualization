# Touch√© Task 1: Argument Retrieval for Controversial Questions
## Team Skeletor

### Five runs
1) BM25 search

k1=3.2, b=0.2, indexed via Pyserini using default settings

2) Semantic (dense) search

Encoder: msmarco-distilbert-base-v3 from SentenceTransformers
Each document is segmented into BERT-sized passages, the passages are encoded and indexed in hnswlib.
Each topic title is encoded, knn search on the passages, take the max of all passage knn returned per document.
Each passage is about 200 words, and k=1000 similar passages are returned per topic title search.


3) Interpolated BM25 and semantic search scores

(1) + 0.7 * (2)


4) Nearest-neighbor pseudo feedback

Using the run from (3), collect the passages from the top k highest-ranked documents (assumed to be relevant).
Then, do knn search using these passages across the entire corpus and aggregate the similarity scores. 

5) Nearest-neighbor pseudo feedback via manifold approximation

TBD...
